For those who are saying this is a 7-2 action by the Supreme Court, that’s wrong. All nine justices would reject the suit by Texas, the other states, and POTUS. Seven of them would refuse to hear the case at all. Two of them believe they have to hear it and would deny relief.
+++||+++Actually, if we are being completely precise, we should say that the court ordered the denial without recorded dissent among the justices. We don’t actually know what the vote was. But no justice recorded a dissent from the order (save the Alito-Thomas statement noted above)
+++||+++@MM2LLC Alito and Thomas believe the court has no authority not to hear a case in their original jurisdiction. It’s a long-standing view of theirs—and there are decent arguments for their position. So the point of hearing it is simply that the court has to (in their view).
+++||+++@MM2LLC So in other words, seven justices would not hear the case, two would (because they believe they have to) and reject it summarily.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes And the point of hearing it if denying relief is a given?

+++||+++@scottjshapiro @benjaminwittes @inlieuoffunshow I kinda love the idea of you starting with the ridiculous goal of getting on a list and then the whole podcast is like your quest for that... which ends up being the true reward
+++||+++@Klonick @scottjshapiro @inlieuoffunshow I think you should do a podcast on organized decision-making.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @Klonick @inlieuoffunshow @BillKristol @alexandracooper @callherdaddy this will be a family podcast
+++||+++@scottjshapiro @Klonick @inlieuoffunshow @BillKristol @alexandracooper @callherdaddy You could alternate questions. @alexandracooper can take the ones about sex and you can handle the ones about legal positivism.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @Klonick @inlieuoffunshow @BillKristol I just want to be on a list. I am not picky. And thanks for the offer, but I'm not going to overthink this.

+++||+++What say you, @benjaminwittes, @Klonick, @inlieuoffunshow?
+++||+++@scottjshapiro @Klonick @inlieuoffunshow What kind of list?
A great podcast along these lines is @BillKristol’s Conversations podcast. Really excellent.
Happy to chat with you about your idea if you want.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @jbordeaux @MiekeEoyang @inlieuoffunshow I have questions.

(who appears to have rejected my suggestion of a tasteful pyramid of cannonballs) https://t.co/07PUpUHter
+++||+++@ConStelz @ratemyskyperoom No! I am not yet done. Cannonballs to come as well as splash of color as @MiekeEoyang has suggested. Both of these elements were voted up by the @inlieuoffunshow audience yesterday.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes Forwarded to my boss, who loves pandas and also capybaras.

It doesn't fully solve your splash of color issue, though.

+++||+++@samuelmoyn Uh, I don’t think that’s what I said...

+++||+++@soledadobrien @jacklgoldsmith @lawfareblog ...in the presidency. It's structurally embedded in the design of the office. This is the basic thesis of @Susan_Hennessey and my book, "Unmaking the Presidency." If we elect Trumps, bad things will happen. And no amount of reform will make such a reckless electoral act safe.

+++||+++@soledadobrien On self-pardons, the main argument for its legality is that the Constitution does not rule it out by its terms.

Also: how is it possible you can self-pardon?? That seems insane!
+++||+++@soledadobrien On self-pardons, the main argument for its legality is that the Constitution does not rule it out by its terms. The traditional Justice Department position is consistent with your instinct: it's just too crazy to contemplate, though the department dresses it up in other terms.

I think.

If so, I will go ahead and announce it.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @Mark_J_Ryan The tweet ain't a pardon, right?
+++||+++@fmbutt @Mark_J_Ryan Correct. The tweet is not a pardon.
+++||+++@gtconway3d @JoyceWhiteVance Yeah, I was wondering about that too. The only thing I can think of that explains everyone's silence is this: There is no pardon yet. The president announced it by tweet. The White House lied in a statement saying it had already been signed.
+++||+++@gtconway3d @JoyceWhiteVance But the DOJ does not yet have it (because it doesn't exist), and it is thus not on DOJ's website (where all the other pardons and commutations are) and not noticed to the court. And it hasn't been given to Sidney Powell yet--which is why she has not moved to dismiss.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @JoyceWhiteVance You'd also think that the Justice Department would have brought it to the attention of the court, since it has already moved to dismiss.
+++||+++@gtconway3d @JoyceWhiteVance Yeah, I was wondering about that too. The only thing I can think of that explains everyone's silence is this: There is no pardon yet. The president announced it by tweet. The White House lied in a statement saying it had already been signed.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes Alright, here’s what you asked for you @inlieuoffunshow monsters (cherry and cool ice cube not included) cc: @Klonick https://t.co/R8Usgm7U4i
+++||+++@mollyxbrady @inlieuoffunshow @Klonick Wow. So in the case of an old fashioned, the pod just contains bitters and syrup and instructions, right?
+++||+++Had an idea for a unifying theory about law based on intuition

Googled &amp; saw that while someone already thought of it 100 years go, his aesthetic &amp; legal philosophy are a sign that he is my spirit animal

&lt;boldly adds "re-discover intuitive law" to research agenda&gt; https://t.co/SLcA26iVcb
+++||+++@Klonick not to mention his glasses
+++||+++@benjaminwittes If I were Flynn's lawyer, I would have filed the motion as soon as Trump announced the pardon. Until that's done, the court retains jurisdiction and can rule on pending matters.
+++||+++@JoyceWhiteVance Yup. If I were Judge Sullivan and I had a lot to say—as he evidently does about the procedural history of this case—I might take this moment to say some of it.
+++||+++@CBHessick @benjaminwittes @OrinKerr @steve_vladeck And if Sullivan denies the motion, Flynn can plead the pardon then. So why bother asserting it right away?
+++||+++@AkivaMCohen @CBHessick @OrinKerr @steve_vladeck But if that were the strategy, why not just ask the president to defer granting the pardon until after Sullivan ruled?
+++||+++The last filling in the case was more than a month ago! Don't you think you should let Judge Sullivan know that the president has pardoned your client? You did, after all, tell the DC Circuit that it needed to step in because time was of the essence.
+++||+++It would be kinda funny if Judge Sullivan ruled on the prior motion to dismiss before you could get your act together to file this one!

#justsayin
+++||+++Lawfare has the sadz. These traitors make me sick. @DonaldJTrumpJr https://t.co/17aFNQ2NfV
+++||+++@AnneBaldwin17 @DonaldJTrumpJr Yeah, me too.
+++||+++The stupidest possible resolution of the Flynn case is that he’s sentenced because his lawyer never actually invokes the pardon, so I give that about a 7% chance of happening https://t.co/Xm75CfvO1i
+++||+++@poorlyhidden That wouldn't happen, because she can plead it any time.
+++||+++Best way to resolve this question is just to ask. Hey @SidneyPowell1, why haven't you moved to dismiss Gen. Flynn's case give the pardon yet? And when can we expect you to do so? @CBHessick and I want to know. https://t.co/01BrO6ABYS
+++||+++The last filling in the case was more than a month ago! Don't you think you should let Judge Sullivan know that the president has pardoned your client? You did, after all, tell the DC Circuit that it needed to step in because time was of the essence.
+++||+++@CBHessick @OrinKerr @steve_vladeck We know that the White House announced that a pardon has been signed: https://t.co/DucLooKgas
+++||+++@CBHessick @OrinKerr @steve_vladeck Perhaps it has not been delivered yet?
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @OrinKerr @steve_vladeck Do we know whether there's an official document that sets out the precise nature of the pardon?
This isn't my area of expertise, but I imagine that Powell wouldn't file anything until she has a copy of that document.
+++||+++@CBHessick @OrinKerr @steve_vladeck We know that the White House announced that a pardon has been signed: https://t.co/DucLooKgas
+++||+++@benjaminwittes What happens if there are legitimate legal questions about the pardon that stretch on past Jan 20?
+++||+++@Mark_J_Ryan Again, I am no expert on pardons, but as I understand it, if he has a pardon (literally has, like, in his hand), it is like a deed--a right conveys with it. And he can plead that to any court.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes Ben, give us some reasons on why this hasn’t happened yet.
+++||+++@Keith__1983 I really can't. Normally, when a pardon issues, it's quite automatic that the defendant goes to court to have the case dismissed. Perhaps Powell is busy with, uh, other things? Perhaps the pardon hasn't actually issued yet? Maybe she doesn't know she needs to plead it?
+++||+++Ok, color me confused. President Trump pardoned Michael Flynn on November 25. According to the Flynn docket, there is still no motion to dismiss the case based on the pardon. I know it's a holiday weekend. And I'm certainly no expert on pardons, But I'm pretty sure that: https://t.co/7OyAOq9Bx6
+++||+++Am I missing something here, @OrinKerr &amp; @CBHessick &amp; @steve_vladeck? Or has Sidney Powell just not bothered yet to get her client's case dismissed?
+++||+++@benjaminwittes Yeah, totally. He won't give up the spotlight to Biden. Even if he goes to the Inauguration he'll squirm and make faces and roll his eyes.
+++||+++@jenmercieca This is my theory. He will go, but he will be demonstratively attention-seeking and will make the story about him.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes I thought he was going to counter-program with his 2024 announcement? lol/cry.
+++||+++@jenmercieca Maybe. My point is that if he's not going to attend and make the story about himself, he will need to think of SOME kind of counter-programming. Because there is no way he's going to leave the attention field to Biden for the day.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes Why do you hate freedom, Ben?
+++||+++@scottjshapiro Because it’s just another word for nothing left to lose—and as a member of the privileged class, I don’t want to sink that low!
+++||+++@benjaminwittes Blaming the victims is ugly, Ben.
+++||+++@scottjshapiro Really focusing on the conduct of the perpetrators, actually. Most people don’t tie THEMSELVES to trolley tracks, after all.
+++||+++@scottjshapiro Or special inspector to make sure that people are not being tied to trolley tracks in the first place. Which is, btw, my problem with all trolley problems: what are all these people doing on the trolley tracks?!?!
+++||+++@scottjshapiro Nobody talks about this, but if we kept people from tying one another to trolley tracks, we could moot out all of the trolley problems...

+++||+++@scottjshapiro Or special inspector to make sure that people are not being tied to trolley tracks in the first place. Which is, btw, my problem with all trolley problems: what are all these people doing on the trolley tracks?!?!
+++||+++This raises an interesting question: What position should @scottjshapiro get in a Biden administration? I think he should be White House staff secretary—the position that controls information flow to POTUS—because he’s clearly so good at organizing decisions. https://t.co/qM18m01ljD
+++||+++But I could also make a case for Assistant Secretary for Trolleys at the Department of Transportation—for obvious reasons.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes OH NO I THREW OUT THE BOX so I have no idea what’s in here BUT I wonder if there’s some kind of amaro flavoring. Here’s the tiny juice cup from whence it comes (I should note this is a crowd favorite when there were once crowds) https://t.co/BuBx9Ro0za
+++||+++@mollyxbrady Huh. Fascinating. But you don’t have a cylinder full of Amaro?
+++||+++@benjaminwittes What should I make in my absurdly and unnecessarily fancy cocktail maker? Video tomorrow!
+++||+++@mollyxbrady Serious question: on the paper plane, how does the amaro get in there? Is it in the pod? Or do you have a cylinder full for amaro?

+++||+++@john_sipher @craignewmark Agreed. It risks it, however.
+++||+++Hey, @benjaminwittes and @john_sipher, there's an effective de facto public private partnership working on countering disinformation, countering violent extremism, and re promoting better cybersecurity. Is there value in formalizing the partnership? Thanks!
+++||+++@craignewmark @john_sipher This is a very interesting question. The risk in formalizing it is that if you set formal responsibilities, they will be understood more rigidly than if people are just cooperating.

+++||+++I groped for something mild to say, something that wouldn’t offend him further. I told him I thought the sign was sort of silly.

He exploded in a tirade.
+++||+++“There is so much oppression in the world! There is so much suffering! There are people starving! And all these assholes can think of is the turkeys!”

The man had a point, even if his passion in expressing it was unnerving me.

I asked him where he was from.

Somalia, he said.
+++||+++I found myself sitting next to a very large and very angry East African man who glared at the sign and then said to me with what seemed like needless belligerence: “What do you think of that?”

A cab pulled up, and I got in the front seat—because in the days before metered cabs in DC, drivers were allowed to pick up more than one fare, and someone else was already occupying the back seat.

+++||+++@benjaminwittes @jycefisher The question was, is Flynn’s son vulnerable to prosecution. Are you saying the pardon encompassed the crime itself and everyone involved, not just Flynn?
+++||+++@hayden0818 @jycefisher A prosecution of Flynn Jr. would be retaliatory. It presumably is not precluded by the pardon but DOJ would not do it for other reasons.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes But didn’t they let Flynn’s son off the hook in connection with his guilty plea?  Wonder if that’s an open issue?
+++||+++@jycefisher Depending on how broadly the pardon is written, it may or may not leave room for his prosecution for other things. I assume that lawyers in the White House counsel’s office will have written it broadly.

+++||+++@SarahEBond @TrismegistosTM @brooklynmuseum @AnnetteYReed @isawnyu It’s a date!
+++||+++@ariehkovler @SarahEBond @TrismegistosTM Interesting!
+++||+++@ariehkovler @SarahEBond @TrismegistosTM It’s pretty cool-looking.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @SarahEBond @TrismegistosTM By the way, the history and culture of the Elephantine Jewish community is SUPER-interesting and we have so many surviving texts of this pre-Rabbinic community with its own Temple.
+++||+++@ariehkovler @SarahEBond @TrismegistosTM I know absolutely nothing about it. Will look into it.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @SarahEBond @TrismegistosTM The Hebrew and Aramaic you've seen is actually printed in an Aramaic alphabet! The original Hebrew alphabet is kind of runic, but was supplanted by the "Ashuri" script about 2000 years ago. https://t.co/sm6769YV1L
+++||+++@ariehkovler @SarahEBond @TrismegistosTM Interesting!
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @TrismegistosTM @brooklynmuseum If you would like to learn more about ancient Jewish communities and discuss these papyri on your next (safe trip) to NYC, I would suggest meeting up with @AnnetteYReed and visiting @isawnyu too.
+++||+++@SarahEBond @TrismegistosTM @brooklynmuseum @AnnetteYReed @isawnyu I will begin by following both, since I have no idea when I will next be able to go to NY.
+++||+++@SarahEBond @TrismegistosTM @brooklynmuseum Wow. I had no idea there were surviving Aramaic texts that old.
+++||+++@SarahEBond @TrismegistosTM @brooklynmuseum @RexChapman this is the ancient Aramaic manuscript Twitter content I’m here for!
+++||+++@benjaminwittes Many thanks for the clarification. Love both @inlieuoffunshow and @RatlSecurity !
+++||+++@mradambradley @inlieuoffunshow @RatlSecurity Thanks! It’s actually an interesting question—one to which I don’t know the answer—why the pardon needs to be pled. I think it’s because the court has to be notified that its jurisdiction has been overridden.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @TrismegistosTM If you would like to see more in person from Elephantine, I would visit the @brooklynmuseum: https://t.co/xKIsRk9rIs
+++||+++@SarahEBond @TrismegistosTM @brooklynmuseum Wow. I had no idea there were surviving Aramaic texts that old.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes Doesn’t the pardon automatically moot the case?
+++||+++@mradambradley No. A pardon has to be pled to the court, which is then obligated to dismiss in the face of it.
+++||+++@OPCGhost He has to rule on the Justice Department’s motion to dismiss, which he probably has to grant. If he doesn’t grant it, the DC Circuit almost certainly will. So the realistic question here is not whether Flynn will walk but how. I prefer a pardon to a judicial action.
+++||+++@OPCGhost The only way we could get the scenario you describe is if Sullivan delays ruling until admin change and then DOJ switches position (again). I think this is implausible.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes Oops, sorry.

Thought you were.

Would he be writing his opinion if a pardon were completely off the table? Thanks.
+++||+++@OPCGhost He has to rule on the Justice Department’s motion to dismiss, which he probably has to grant. If he doesn’t grant it, the DC Circuit almost certainly will. So the realistic question here is not whether Flynn will walk but how. I prefer a pardon to a judicial action.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes Do you think it would be worth Judge Sullivan handing down a ruling before the pardon? It would be moot, in practical terms, but it might establish the court's authority over the matter.
+++||+++@mradambradley I would prefer to see Judge Sullivan rule AFTER the pardon, which will need to be pled to him. That way, he can dismiss the case (as he must if the pardon issues) and say whatever he feels like saying along the way.
+++||+++@SarahEBond @TrismegistosTM Wow. How do we know it’s a draft?
+++||+++@SarahEBond @TrismegistosTM And what a fabulous character set! I’m not sure I have ever seen contemporaneous Aramaic script—only modern printed Aramaic using the Hebrew alphabet.
+++||+++November 25, 407 BCE: In a draft letter in Aramaic, Yedaniah bar-Gemariah &amp; the other Jewish priests on the Nile island city of Elephantine petition the Persian governor of Yehud (Judea) under Darius II, named Bagavahya, so that they might rebuild the Temple there (SMB P 13495). https://t.co/x2exYah2a2
+++||+++@SarahEBond @TrismegistosTM Wow. How do we know it’s a draft?
+++||+++@OPCGhost I don’t either. But I don’t think that’s likely to happen. Judge Sullivan is writing his opinion now. It come out soon. Why the confidence that there’s a chance this could happen?
+++||+++@OPCGhost And for the record, I am not a lawyer.
+++||+++@OPCGhost @benjaminwittes Benjamin, you should read this response a few time and make sure you understand what Fred is saying. It’s an important distinction.
+++||+++@Anthony48796308 @OPCGhost See my response
+++||+++@benjaminwittes I don't prefer it to an uncorrupted Justice Department picking up the case in a couple of months and handling it properly.

But I'm not a cynical lawyer who finds justice in injustice.
+++||+++@OPCGhost I don’t either. But I don’t think that’s likely to happen. Judge Sullivan is writing his opinion now. It come out soon. Why the confidence that there’s a chance this could happen?
+++||+++In the case, for example, of Lt. Col. Alex Vindman, this suggests that someone who served our country honorably, then told the truth to Congress under oath and whose veracity has been unchallenged, is unacceptable to today's congressional Republicans.

+++||+++@milk So this would be a different model of workout than the playlist model. Bolero runtime is about 17-20 minutes, depending on tempo. It builds in intensity over the course of the piece, and the idea would be have it start off low-intensity and build to high-intensity...

+++||+++@benjaminwittes DOJ needs a non-partisan attorney general.  Yates or Monaco would be excellent in normal times, which these are not.  Distinguished former judge or law professor would be best.  E.g., Justice Souter, Chief Judge Katzmann from Second Citcuit.

+++||+++...save Lisa for that role.
+++||+++I don't know how to game out that possibility because Trump could fire Wray tomorrow or not at all--and I don't know Biden's plans vis a vis Wray either. 

But my bottom line is this: Lisa would be a first-rate candidate in either role.
+++||+++Incidentally, the FBI Director role is a much harder one to fill than the attorney general. There are many fewer people qualified to do that job. Lisa is VERY well qualified that role. So if Biden expects Wray to be removed or expects to remove him, he might plausibly...
+++||+++...save Lisa for that role.
+++||+++The reason, speaking candidly, that she has not been on my list is that I have assumed the incumbent president was going to fire Chris Wray and that Lisa would be a leading candidate for FBI Director. She would be excellent in either role.

+++||+++@benjaminwittes i dunno it seems like our current system was thrown together out of contingent political expediency and has a lot of screamingly obvious failings, whereas even a democracy as troubled as Brazil has no problem swiftly and reliably counting votes
+++||+++@AlexYablon You are limiting the problem to counting votes. My point is not just about counting votes. It's about getting people who lost out of office. Counting votes is only part of that.
+++||+++@AlexYablon Some much better than others. I, for one, would not be confident in the vote counting in Hungary or Poland—both recently consolidated democracies. And I would not be confident either in those countries' ability to dislodge leaders even if they unambiguously lost.
+++||+++@AlexYablon But I defer to @anneapplebaum on this. If she tells me that parliamentary or mixed systems have all solved this problem, then sure....
+++||+++@benjaminwittes literally every other democratic country in the world has figured this out

+++||+++@AlexYablon Who would be responsible for counting the votes? Who would certify who had won the majority of them? And critically, whom would those officials work for and what would prevent a president from summoning them to the White House to demand that they find fraud?
+++||+++@AlexYablon I'm not saying there is no answer to this question. There are many potential answers. But they need to be thought through carefully. Our current system has thought through this question very carefully. And it's answers are exquisitely refined.
+++||+++@AlexYablon The electoral college has a great many problems. This is one of its strengths.

Imagine that we scrapped it and replaced it with a national popular vote to elect the president.

+++||+++@benjaminwittes @jadler1969 @Richard_Primus @jacklgoldsmith If, on the other hand, they intend to say that they heard the president out but explained that, as much as they sympathize with his concerns, what he is asking is practically impossible and constitutionally ineffective, then it may make sense from their perspective. 2/2
+++||+++@mls1776 @jadler1969 @Richard_Primus @jacklgoldsmith Except that it exposes them to risk from HIS account of what happened in the meeting.

+++||+++@jadler1969 @CBHessick @Richard_Primus @jacklgoldsmith I think an attorney representing them should have SERIOUS anxieties about their having a private meeting with a desperate man who has paid off sex workers and sought to extort the president of a sovereign nation while he is openly campaigning to overturn adverse election results.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @Richard_Primus Yes,  but also spends much time on the more speculative and sensational scenarios.
The meeting is icky, but risk of prosecution minimal.
+++||+++@jadler1969 @Richard_Primus I’ll leave the dispute to the two of you. I’ll ask instead a simple question: if you were their lawyer and they asked you whether to take a private meeting with POTUS under these circumstances, what would you say? @jacklgoldsmith
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @Richard_Primus A bit over done, in that the pitch may simply be a threat to turn his supporters against them should they not help him.

+++||+++@jadler1969 I have suggested that he ask Merrick Garland to come off the bench to be AG. I think Chuck Rosenberg meets this standard. Mary Jo White would be an excellent choice, as would @PreetBharara. Randy Moss is another judicial option.
+++||+++@jadler1969 @PreetBharara These are the sort of names we should be talking about. We need the Ed Levi of our time.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes Who would meet that standard?
(In my view, someone lkke Holder would not.)

+++||+++@benjaminwittes The problem is not just the reality but the perception: how does he make people believe that this is what happened, given not just Bill Barr but the GOP perception of recent Democratic AGs?
+++||+++@SteveBellovin This is why I believe he has to be extremely imaginative and ambitious in his choice of attorney general. I have suggested that he ask Merrick Garland to come off the bench. But it has to be someone with an unimpeachable reputation for independence.
+++||+++It's very simple. The president appoints an attorney general. He gives that person no instructions regarding how to handle the former president. Then he has zero contact with that person or the DOJ about it. His role after picking the AG is limited to deciding whether to pardon. https://t.co/hlM6ayEWMt
+++||+++This is why the choice of attorney general is so important. It has to be someone who will have credibility in declining a case and in bringing a case. And in both situations, it has to be someone who will have credibility in saying "This decision was mine."
+++||+++I did attend the actual Million Man March just to check it out and man it was super weird.
+++||+++@morningmoneyben Me too. And yeah it was weird--but not as weird as the Promise Keepers gathering in DC.

+++||+++There does not appear to be an editor's note explaining the editorial purpose. Given the time of publication, June 1941--during a prior of US formal neutrality but backing of UK--I assume it must have been to show how horrible he was. But I am not sure. Does anyone know?
+++||+++Aha. Thanks to astute readers for pointing out that there is, in fact, an editor's note: https://t.co/aAbts1akSu
+++||+++To be precise. It's excerpts from Mein Kampf. Not clear to me why they published it at this stage--more than a decade after its publication.

+++||+++...to the next would-be whistleblower? What advice will the next @natsechobbyist give her husband?
+++||+++And for some people there are emotional issues too. People’s whole identifies are wrapped up in public service. Some people also have ruinous legal bills. It is a very complex problem. And it’s important to signal that we will honor, care for, and protect those who do right. https://t.co/Hm32pGOiCx

+++||+++I propose the following: The @macfound should announce TODAY a conditional MacArthur Fellowship for Anthony Fauci in the event of his firing. We have to make clear that those who do right in government have futures. The philanthropic community has a key role to play here. https://t.co/atZIOkqiM3

+++||+++@benjaminwittes 594 seems to be the direct act of voting but IANAL.

I was not aware of 241. Holy smokes it's broad. Presumably, like civil rights investigations of cops, a backdoor to get in when local authorities refuse to act?
+++||+++@DrJJoyner If memory serves, it was passed to broaden federal authority over hate crimes, but yes, it’s super-broad. And there’s visual evidence in the video that raises a serious question under it.
+++||+++@DrJJoyner I could see a 594 issue.
Look also at 241.
+++||+++@DrJJoyner This video is unquestionably a reasonable predicate for a federal civil rights investigation. @KristenClarkeJD

+++||+++@benjaminwittes @YAppelbaum @RyanLizza Yes, yes it is. Lets do math: 100% of 50% of VEP = 50% of VEP has voted in Texas. 60% of 70% of VEP = 42% of VEP has voted in Wisconsin, e.g. the disparity is not as wide as u think precisely bc sun belt states had low turnout in 2016

+++||+++@benjaminwittes @YAppelbaum @RyanLizza @emilybazelon Okay 1) yes but I wanted to know if you were inherently a conservative. I wasn’t trying to “win”. You seem (to me) to be sympathetic to the conservative cause. You answered my questions. I am satisfied, short of an actual conversation. 2) side kick to the chest is easily defended

(2) My repertoire is not limited to side kicks to the chest.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @YAppelbaum @RyanLizza @emilybazelon Lol. You still think a side kick to the chest is the best way to dispatch Putin? Tbh he’s probably fast enough to defend. Plus if he gets ahold of your leg you’re done. Never kick above the knee. I still think he’s a phony and you could take him though.
+++||+++@dangerdaveball @YAppelbaum @RyanLizza @emilybazelon I think you just changed the subject.

And yes, my challenge to Putin still stands.

+++||+++@dangerdaveball @YAppelbaum @RyanLizza @emilybazelon Nope. Keep trying.
+++||+++@YAppelbaum @RyanLizza Your broader point about turnout in these states is a fair one. But @RyanLizza’s question was about what’s driving the disparity. The disparity is HUGE even if you make the turnout denominator a constant percentage of eligible voters. The reason is that what’s driving...
+++||+++@YAppelbaum @RyanLizza ...it is the early/mail-in voting policies of the states in question.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @RyanLizza It’s the percentage voting early now *relative to* the total 2016 turnout. In TX, only 51.4% of VEP voted in 2016; in WI, 69.5%. Even with this early-voting surge, TX may not hit 69.5% of VEP.

And the simple reality is that certain sunbelt states (with Republican leadership, actually) are wildly over-performing. And certain northeastern states have a lot to answer for.
+++||+++@YAppelbaum @RyanLizza There is no excuse for the low numbers from NY, CT, and PA.
+++||+++@RyanLizza TX, GA, NV, and AZ all had 2016 turnout below 60% of their voting-eligible population. There are other factors—notably, migration—but a good chunk of this is just their turnout surging up to where the other states have been.

+++||+++@kiwano1 @inlieuoffunshow It’s a very complicated subject. Happy to discuss.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes Great minds . . . https://t.co/4A0obhfLIQ
+++||+++@petermshane Indeed!
+++||+++@benjaminwittes I've heard worse ideas for AG. But being a judge an running an entire agency are different skills. He may have both sets but just because he's liked doesn't mean he can manage.
+++||+++@RachelLarris Merrick Garland was a principal manager of the DOJ—he served as PADAG—during the Clinton administration. The DAG then, Jamie Gorelick, was widely admired as a terrific manager of the department. She would tell you that he was one of the reasons.
+++||+++If I were Biden, and I were to win the election, I would call Garland personally and tell him it is his patriotic duty to come off the bench and become attorney general. He is the closest thing the country has right now to an Ed Levi figure to restore the Justice Department. https://t.co/ztXcghYfWL
+++||+++I suspect Garland, who plainly loves being a judge, would resist the idea.  But the department needs someone of his stature and cross-partisan admiration for what will be an immensely trying and painful period.
There are very few such people right now.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes And Barrett was the least qualified nominee to be confirmed in at least 30 years.
+++||+++@lisawborden Barrett is qualified in every traditional sense. A significant academic career plus three years in the federal appellate bench is nothing to sneeze at. MG’s career, however, was in a whole different zone.

+++||+++@scottjshapiro @SarahLongwell25 That’s as close to a booking as we are likely to get from @scottjshapiro ....
+++||+++@benjaminwittes @CarolLeonnig @nytimes Too confining, I’d say, for journalistic purposes. Any assistant AG is plenty senior to talk about DOJ, for example, especially in her area of responsibility. It’s context dependent. But I’m talking here about news coverage generally, not the NYT handling of Anonymous.
+++||+++@bartongellman @CarolLeonnig @nytimes I’m fine with calling an assistant AG a “senior DOJ official.”
+++||+++Not siding with anyone but just as a reporter: a  #2 or #4 at a key agency would be considered a senior administration official. You can't have this guy as both an architect of child separation and a nobody https://t.co/S08xWARPrG

+++||+++@CarolLeonnig @bartongellman @nytimes I would say that a senior administration official is either one of the two or three top senate-confirmed officials in an agency or is senior White House staff.

+++||+++@benjaminwittes @evelyndouek Before you decide, talk to the business journalists outside the US. Ask how free they feel to do investigative pieces on the rich and powerful. Outfits like @ICIJorg exist for a reason: there's strength in numbers, and that matters in hostile legal environments.
+++||+++@dianabhenriques @evelyndouek @ICIJorg I don't think @evelyndouek was talking about hostile media environments. I think she was talking about places like Canada and Australia. I also don't think people need to talk to foreign journalists before deciding whether or not to treat her abusively online.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes Careful Ben. This might turn out to be your most controversial opinion too. And.. yes... i know
+++||+++@evelyndouek Dude, no.
+++||+++And while I have seen cases in which I think this power has been stretched in ways that make me deeply uncomfortable (thinking about one mentally ill Muslim American man whom I don’t believe posed a real threat, in particular), I very much agree with @kathleen_belew that we...
+++||+++...need these laws. It’s important for the FBI to be able to get to the left of boom—and this case is a good example of why.
+++||+++That means that you can, at least theoretically, be charged with conspiring with someone who turns out to be an FBI agent to provide material support for terrorist activity. Which is to say the violence can be pretty damn inchoate and the activity still unambiguously criminal.

+++||+++@benjaminwittes Agree except on climate, that battle needed to have been fought years ago. We’re out of time.
+++||+++@rstackjr Yes and no. The initial steps on climate are to undo a whole lot of executive actions Trump took. That will actually take a little bit of doing. Legislation on this subject will take a LOT of negotiation. So it’s not a first 100 days thing under any circumstances.

+++||+++Answer:
https://t.co/9BTKqXRKDg
+++||+++@djpressman My point is that an initial agenda that focuses on the values that bind all anti-Trump forces is disciplining, would be broadly popular, and can actually keep together the coalition that has opposed Trump.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes https://t.co/B9AuhJEJOq
+++||+++@bartona104 Exactly
+++||+++Which of you assholes is taking orders from Ben Wittes? Show yourselves. https://t.co/tjM6tXkYWR
+++||+++@jensmyth Agreed! I hate that guy.
+++||+++I see the logic, but if you are dying from systemic racism or limited or absent medical care NOW or starving NOW because of the recession, just wait is not going to cut it. Depends on what "we get control of the coronavirus" includes. https://t.co/oFy5nQIShl
+++||+++@djpressman Construe it broadly. And construe political reforms to include policing issues.
+++||+++@DLind I actually don’t think so. I think the vast majority of #NeverTrump conservatives will be pretty on-board with a root-and-branch repudiation.
+++||+++@DLind I think an initial, first-two-years agenda based on (2) &amp; (3) would have wide support from left to sane right. I think you could also add to it major economic support for those who need it.
+++||+++@benjaminwittes Isn’t part of the issue here that what some members of the coalition would describe as “policy differences” per 4, others would describe as “Trumpism and all its works” per 1?
+++||+++@DLind I actually don’t think so. I think the vast majority of #NeverTrump conservatives will be pretty on-board with a root-and-branch repudiation.
+++||+++Then and only then, fourth, do we argue about the serious policy differences among us.
+++||+++If a battle does not need to be fought now, it needs to not be fought now.
+++||+++Order of operations for the #CoalitionOfAllDemocraticForces

First, we defeat Trumpism and all its works.

Second, we get control of the coronavirus and thus allow the economy to recover.

Third, we enact the political and anti-corruption reforms on which 90 percent of us agree.
+++||+++Then and only then, fourth, do we argue about the serious policy differences among us.
