## saved tweets go here

The tweets stored in this folder are the result of running "twitter_scraper.py"

If you want to save tweets or other types of conversations a different way, 
make sure you use the same separators.

* "+++|+++" to separate question/answer

* "+++$+++" to separate pairs of q/a
