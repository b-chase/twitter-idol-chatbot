I would get it if restaurants still weren’t open lol

+++||+++To me “Faith” is obviously superior, as it’s at least a deliberately dumb goofy cover of a song that was never that great to begin with, and you can’t say it doesn’t add anything, where “Blue Monday” is just a less interesting version of a decent song.

+++||+++Oh we have plenty of those too. Two fish tanks, five snakes, a couple dozen tarantulas (most of which are babies), two tortoises and an outdoor turtle. And now four mantids. https://t.co/3ufrVULBlx
+++||+++tarantulas are way cheaper when they’re slings (that’s spider industry talk for spiderlings) so we get them as babies and see which ones survive to adulthood/are female. The males only live a few years so you want females, which can live up to 20 years depending on species.
+++||+++@thelindsayellis Do you have any orchid mantises?
+++||+++@Jungie26 Are those the native ones? We had some for pest control but they have a way of disappearing

+++||+++@thelindsayellis This show is borderline triggering for me—not because of the content itself, which is lameass trolling, but because it was the sort of thing my brother would have on in the background while beating me up,which honestly seems to go hand in hand with what you’d expect tbqh
+++||+++@whyangelinawhy yeah, weird that a show that normalizes objectifying women as funny and cool would train kids to follow that to its logical conclusion. weird.
+++||+++@thelindsayellis For at least a few years, this aired after the early Jon Stewart Daily Show (which I loved), and it nearly prompted an existential crisis in me.
+++||+++@emilyvdw well that explains why I'd seen so many episodes, I forgot about that lineup
+++||+++@thelindsayellis The degree to which I felt intense distaste at that show and thought, "Well, if I don't like this show, maybe I'm not a man," then didn't cross the gap................
+++||+++@emilyvdw I mean I would like to think that basic human decency might be a barrier for entry fwiw
+++||+++Had to look at some clips for a video, and I am here to confirm that The Man Show is, indeed, worse than you remember it. I remember trying to be charitable at the time because I listened to Loveline, but most of the jokes genuinely are just "triggered, feminists???"
+++||+++To the people who are only now learning that The Man Show was, in fact, a very popular Comedy Central show that aired for several years that featured "the juggy dance squad" and ended every episode with "girls jumping on trampolines," I welcome you to the early 00's. It was bad.
+++||+++@thelindsayellis Lol shilling you make it sound like he doesn't believe what he says? I honestly have no idea
+++||+++@BenKnight0 nah you're right, I think he believes it
+++||+++@thelindsayellis Kimmel and the super conservative guy are still friends so he's probably fine with it.
+++||+++@JonPlot idgi kimmel, the guy is using what meager clout he has to make the world worse, cut your losses man jeez
+++||+++I wonder how Jimmy Kimmel feels about the fact that The Man Show made him famous, especially considering his former Man Show cohost now makes his living advocating against the "nanny state" and shilling for Prager U 

this isn't a "down with kimmel" tweet I am genuinely curious

+++||+++@thelindsayellis I just don’t understand why we’re holding him to the standard of depicting a realistic, inoffensive  nonbinary character when absolutely none of his characters are in any way realistic or inoffensive.  He is literally writing at the edge of his talents.
+++||+++@LemonBriquette because he clearly included this to demonstrate growth based on widespread criticism of transphobic passages in the first book. he didn't need to include anything about trans people or gender identity, and people are allowed to discuss why they think this attempt failed.
+++||+++@thelindsayellis a take that only someone whose only knowledge of the book is a bad-faith plot summary that thinks K&amp;A's initial meeting is "kind of icky" would arrive at
+++||+++@BeesSchnees relationship arcs. what a concept!
+++||+++@TamashiiHiroka @thelindsayellis For real, Axiom's End is a sci-fi book that makes the importance of autonomy and consent a key issue.
+++||+++@JustPlainTweets @TamashiiHiroka I knew the “so this is rape right” hot takes were coming bc everything has to go to 11 now but even still I’m like “guys.... words mean things”
+++||+++Also last time I mildly criticized this passage someone (now deleted) called me a hypocrite because “doesn’t your book have the protagonist falling in love with their rapist???” and like, er, 1) interesting interpretation of a book I’m sure you 100% read, 2) what the hell lol
+++||+++I knew I had to ease up on my Ready Player # content because it might get me a slap on the wrist from my agent/publisher, totally did not anticipate accusations of hypocrisy based on bad faith second hand interpretations of a book they didn’t read wheeeeee #authorlife #amwriting
+++||+++And no, it is not the same thing as writing about actual oppression of marginalized groups. That’s not the same as reassuring a group of people that you seem to think exists only for sexual reasons that they are fuckable. No Ace Ventura projectile vomit here!

+++||+++@thelindsayellis Maybe trans people can just exist in this book without any sort of activism attached to it? Trans people are people, and all people are fucked up. You don’t necessarily need to paint the trans character or the part of the story as 100% virtuous, 100% of the time
+++||+++@marcelogaia1 I agree - I just didn’t want people to conflate “stories about oppression of marginalized groups” with this sort of thing. Personally I feel like he could have had that very thing, if he didn’t invade this character‘s privacy, and didn’t make it about her fuckability
+++||+++So again I can’t speak for trans people, but I can speak for myself, and any framing that assumes that your reader/viewer is coming in with the assumption that “this group of people is somehow deviant, but don’t worry I don’t think they’re deviant,” does not help said group

+++||+++Like he could’ve maybe had one trans person look over the book, and try to explain to him “maybe don’t try to frame gender identity as who is and is not fuckable by your notorious tool of a protagonist?” Like the first place his mind goes upon learning this is “oh T-girl porn”
+++||+++And I was wondering how this slipped by since clearly he is trying to demonstrate that he listened to criticism, but I suspect the reason why he didn’t do an effort is because he was assured that the haters and losers would come for him anyway so he may as well write  whatever

+++||+++@thelindsayellis I don't think this is intended to be literally true, though? Like, its a figure of speech, no? I think the point is more like "most artists judge their own work more harshly than the majority of other people judge it"
+++||+++@JohnCarlWrites And I’m just saying that’s not been my experience lol. I think once you reach a certain level people are eager to take you down a peg
+++||+++@thelindsayellis That's true, and I think there is a definite sexism and double-standards that I think is enormously frustrating. I think it might also be the case that you are perceived as a definitive authority because of your status, which might warp people's expectations.
+++||+++@FB_BMB that's certainly been the case with the novel - I don't know how much "this is a debut" I needed to push for people to not expect gd dostoevsky right out of the gate, but here we are. truly, I *have* tricked people into thinking I am smarter than I am, lol
+++||+++@thelindsayellis Do you get that weird thing though where you have to limit how much you read back through your stuff cause you know it's going to look like shit eventually if you've seen it a million times?
+++||+++@Yoppchop yeah, but problem is when you do it professionally you have to because there are so many drafts, but there are definitely diminishing returns with each re-read
+++||+++@thelindsayellis To be fair not everyone has Addison Cain stans to absolutely roast their novels on goodreads
+++||+++@biggestjoel sadly I think most of the one star reviews made by curiously new accounts with little or no activity are sargon stans haha sadface
+++||+++@thelindsayellis I think this is a lot of the thing with creatives: we know and lived the process and so we always punish ourselves for the perceived failures and compromises. Most viewers instead see it from the whole, and more likely to accept those things unless it becomes an actual issue.
+++||+++@FB_BMB yeah but my point is kind of the opposite lol. I agree that a majority of viewers are more forgiving, but even with my own laundry list of perceived failures I'm often taken aback at how harshly my work is judged, especially compared to my (usually male) peers
+++||+++@thelindsayellis To be fair you only criticize your art whereas in the modern era critics can occasionally just call you a straight up shitty person and it will only be tangentially related to your work.
+++||+++@xCRISTIANxMusic oh don't worry, I get plenty of that too
+++||+++I gotta be honest I'm a pretty big downer where my own work is concerned and I'm pretty sure I'm nowhere near my harshest critic https://t.co/64yzrKYamX

+++||+++@BillCorbett @acyloxy I have a difficult time mustering any compassion for him outside of the detached academic sort one should have for any addict, considering the data shows that the “bootstraps, Bucko” approach to addiction usually does more harm than good.
+++||+++@BillCorbett @acyloxy Like, it would be one thing if he was just some rando, but he is a millionaire who has built a brand off of telling people how to live their lives and his ideology nearly killed him. I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that he is not going to realize that.
+++||+++@thelindsayellis @BillCorbett His approach so far seems to be that he's a victim of incompetent doctors. He takes no personal responsibility.
+++||+++@himpathetic @BillCorbett Poetic, really
+++||+++@thelindsayellis @BillCorbett Getting obliterated on benzos is honestly the most relatable part of his arc
+++||+++@acyloxy @BillCorbett I mean I totally relate to having a two year bender, but I can’t help but feel like the “clean your room bucko” mindset that shames people for perceived failures and inadequacies can make an already extant predilection for addiction worse than it might have been

+++||+++I know people who are friends with Cline and they all say he’s a very nice person and I’m sure he is, but fucksake he’s also a millionaire who owns two Deloreans. He couldn’t hire a few outside editors/sensitivity readers if he absolutely had to include gender stuff?
+++||+++Like maybe I’m over cautious because I have spent a *lot* of money on this very thing for my second book and I don’t have an nth of Cline’s money, but at this stage “his heart was in the right place” really doesn’t cut it. That this passage made it to the final draft is baffling.
+++||+++Weird that this is the tweet that got media taken down due to copyright, despite being (in my opinion) pretty obviously fair use but oh well who cares copyright is the only thing that matters https://t.co/CMps8vrS2f

+++||+++@thelindsayellis I mean it's only popular because it was so forgettable, that it was allowed to be played for free by early broadcast companies to fill dead air christmas broadcast hours.

+++||+++@thelindsayellis right like what did they remember the movie as being ABOUT a man gets grumpy at christmas then remembers he loves his family?? like we remember the plot of a movie that is on every christmas
+++||+++@JessiSheron hot take: did you know it's a wonderful life would never have been made in the 90's starring tim allen?
+++||+++In fact the only reason we remember it at all is because of a clerical error, the copyright was believed lapsed in 1974, entered the public domain and then NBC was like "hey, free movie," and started airing it after the parade every year, codifying the film as a holiday classic.
+++||+++This of course phased out as a holiday tradition once the copyright holders got the rights back (it's still under copyright), but at least it has a legacy now. watch it if you haven't, 40's schmaltz ("an old maid??") notwithstanding it's a great movie. I watch it every year.
+++||+++this is such a weird take, like who doesn't remember that the entire plot of the film hinges on George Bailey's near-suicide? the fact that it takes place during Christmas is kind of incidental, and it's mostly remembered as such bc it aired after the Macy's parade every year

+++||+++@petsobel I mean you can feel pressured to endanger yourself for work and still care about the severity of the pandemic. if your government is pressuring you while also literally telling you there's nothing to fear, that's very different
+++||+++@thelindsayellis This person is right - the fact that the federal government is offering no aid for covid, no paid sick leave, etc is directly related to people giving up and not caring anymore

+++||+++it annoys me when well-off white Americans start publicly waxing poetic about leaving the country when things start looking back, but these last few days have definitely been giving me some "I could probably get a work visa in Germany, right?" intrusive thoughts https://t.co/xohu6V4ZGP

+++||+++Democrats didn't flip 1 state legislature
GOP held state legislatures in TX, NC, IA, PA and MI, and flipped NH
GOP picked up at least 8 House seats

So how does it make sense only Biden benefited from an utter catastrophe for Democrats?

It doesn't.

At what point, according to them, are we allowed to feel happiness? When the USA because USSR 2.0?
+++||+++@thelindsayellis @Hbomberguy @biggestjoel my favorite part is upon checking his twitter, he thinks there's a conspiracy with some sort of group chat rather than just one person noticing it, mentioning it on Twitter, and a bunch of other people checking.

so it's taking the piss out of tankies?
If so, I am all in on that.
+++||+++@woedenaz @SeanMegaByte They are stunningly easy to bait too. Genuinely horrified at the concept of brunch. The word “brunch” alone usually gets me at least two enraged quote tweets. I wish I was exaggerating

This is hilariously stupid. Nothing good comes from discouraging people to vote and encouraging them to engage in revolution.

I block him.

So I guess he's right?  I mean, I did lose him.
+++||+++@JamesSACorey well you know SF is notoriously apolitical so
+++||+++@thelindsayellis I mean, he did say people who you *love and care about* that voted the other way. If you don’t have any of those then it’s a trivial task
+++||+++@maxc202 again, would these people do the same for you? even the ones you love and care about? the answer is probably no. I don't know a single person with trump voting family members that expressed empathy to them when trump won
+++||+++A lot of people are misconstruing this as a call for retribution - that's not what I mean at all. There's a big difference between wanting retribution and spending your finite emotional resources on someone who would not do the same for you.
+++||+++I'll humor this once I see a slew of thinkpieces on like The Federalist and The Daily Wire about "healing the divide" and "showing empathy to your political opponents." Until then, these demands for compassion and empathy have always been and continue to be one-sided.
+++||+++How many trump supporters did that for you in 2016? https://t.co/HGeBy4cuzO
+++||+++A lot of people are misconstruing this as a call for retribution - that's not what I mean at all. There's a big difference between wanting retribution and spending your finite emotional resources on someone who would not do the same for you.
+++||+++@thelindsayellis What they did or didn't do says something about them, but what you choose to do now speaks about you. I understand the desire for retribution, but retribution is less relevant than making things better.
+++||+++@tearspell Who said anything about retribution?
+++||+++@thelindsayellis I thought we didn't want to BE like Trump supporters. I thought that was the point. That the cruelty WAS the point for Trump supporters, so we shouldn't be like that in return.
+++||+++@SaintHeartwing That doesn’t mean you have to reach out and empathize. Not being cruel isn’t the same as expending your own finite emotional energy for someone who would not do the same for you

I got Steve Blum to sign something for you as Starscream.

+++||+++@notreallykraut one of the great successes of nazi propaganda was their success at connoting fascism with "being smart" in the eyes of, say, Americans, even now. people genuinely can't seem to get that fascists tend not to be that bright, and that your incompetence can undermine your own fascism

+++||+++@thelindsayellis *checks his multiple stringed corkboards*

Wait...wait, that's it. THAT'S IT. It all ties together. Don't you see? She called her book Axiom's End. Axiom's END. End!

Why didn't I see this sooner when that character was called Ampersand?
+++||+++@NickPiers obelus, meant to "divide" us, but it was just a red herring
+++||+++Sure. And what did Trump do? He encouraged the states to open up, which caused further spreading of the disease. And he berated those states that decided to lockdown. https://t.co/Uy61Pi5qi8
+++||+++@notreallykraut also the 10th amendment thing isn't really accurate - dem govs had to use it to mandate lockdowns despite trump telling them to do otherwise (!!), not the other way around. and supreme court didn't rule anything re: a pandemic.
+++||+++@thelindsayellis And it was toothless, short lived and did not have wide support. Every leftist that actually organized real people under Obama can tell you the fear of complacency is nothing to scoff at, most white people want peace, rather than fix all the problems we were actually living under
+++||+++@CoronaDLaurel eh we're getting into the weeds when ultimately I think we're in agreement - my point is, I don't think a dem presidency necessarily means complacency but allows opportunity for progress, especially in light of all that's happened and how divided things still are.
+++||+++@kat_blaque @malhaku That's my biggest concern too - really scary thing is the stage has been set for a shrewd right-wing populist, one with the same rhetoric but without trump's lack of impulse control. But I don't see "we did it, back to brunch" from anyone, even facebook boomer dems.
+++||+++@kat_blaque @malhaku (I mean, *I* have been doing that, but that's just because the bad faith people who are so mad about the mere concept of brunch are so comically easy to bait lol)
+++||+++@malhaku @thelindsayellis That's a HUGE part of why this concerns me. There's so so so much more than Trump and I just don't want people to act shocked when, after 4 years, these people are even more organized and have gained even more favor and influence.

+++||+++@kat_blaque Obama era complacency feels a little bit like revisionism though--Occupy Wall street was under Obama, BLM began under Obama, Sanders rose to national prominence under Obama--just because progressive activism wasn't under the pall of existential terror doesn't mean it wasn't real.
+++||+++@kat_blaque Like, the last four years have been a fight to push the needle back to the status quo from the end of 2016, only to end up worse off than we were four tears ago. At least under a progressive admin there's room to make progress, and I don't think the will is going anywhere
+++||+++AGAIN, I fear the Obama era complacency that set the foundation for Trump and I believe that if a similar candidate is elected, he will not be as much of an idiot. I'm not convinced that Biden is a president that will prevent that.

me saying "I'm relieved this man, who is at least capable of performing empathy which the current president is not," is immediately condoning every bad policy position he ever took. y'all are exhausting.

+++||+++@TriRobSick are you kidding
+++||+++Like, I’m so done with the blackpilled left. Being relieved that the fascists are being removed from power in favor of a moderate that will take the ongoing crisis seriously does not mean we don’t know there’s work left to do but seriously. Give us five damn minutes lol

+++||+++I feel like Twitter makes one lose a sense of perspective; yeah Joe was never Our Boy, but this is the most progressive Democrat ticket that has ever ran, and it won against a fascist who had the whole power of government behind him.

Consequences, yo.

+++||+++@thelindsayellis @Sans_Fi I'm not trying to go back and shit talk your response to the Contrapoints thing, I'm saying that I disagree with what you said about there not being a benefit to "picking a side" most of the time bc it'll piss people off.
+++||+++@greatskycircles @Sans_Fi Oh, well I mean that is true of most things though? But I just think calling me a coward knowing how much harassment it would invite is funny
+++||+++@thelindsayellis Shocking that they don’t know how to spell your name, that’s the real surprise here
+++||+++@biggestjoel weird how they correctly gendered me tho. probably an honest mistake on their part
+++||+++@thelindsayellis I never implied you were part of the "crime"
You've made assumptions and projected on me an agenda that i don't share.
I wanted to know why picking on that person mattered. If you couldn't see why they were annoyed by everything that happened when it directly affects them
+++||+++@PinkHairedCat “picking on” someone whose name is blacked out who calls me a coward for sticking by my friend who they also misgendered? Just how high is the road I’m supposed to take?

And no, their accusation that she is NBphobic is a lie and their “annoyances” are unfounded
+++||+++@greatskycircles She literally wrote "me sticking by her in a time of crisis." two tweets above this one.
+++||+++@Sans_Fi @greatskycircles yeah wtf if I was concerned with optics I would have literally done the opposite lmao
+++||+++@thelindsayellis I'm just curious if you can't see why non binary and other trans people would be rather annoyed. It's fine to stand by your friend, but don't stand by their mistakes.
+++||+++@PinkHairedCat I did and do think the allegations ranged from “blown out of proportion” to “outright lies” so I don’t see what you want me to add here. She addressed it, I’m not going to add anything to that, because, and I cannot stress this enough, I had nothing to do with “the crime”
+++||+++@thelindsayellis Why the fuck am i still following you lmao

+++||+++@hypnotransgirl It’s true, only thing that’s changed is my attempts to reason with them, because they deny reality and cannot be reasoned with. Only hope some of them grow out of it and realize how shitty and detached from reality their behavior was
+++||+++The funniest (by which I mean saddest) thing about the whole stupid ordeal was just the rage when her colleagues didn’t publicly capitulate like these people demanded. Like the tactics to shame a person they don’t know into isolation from friends didn’t work, how very dare
+++||+++Like generally in a controversy there’s not a huge benefit to publicly picking a side, because one way or the other you’re going to piss some people off (and in this case lose some fans). But I’m the coward. Sure, Jan

lol I’m not mad you’re mad
+++||+++I still think about this a lot, this sweet little ~ode~ to my friendship with Natalie (screencap from Canceling), whom I cherish deeply. How sweet of them to make this tribute to me sticking by her in a time of crisis. https://t.co/sGjPIBrtnx

+++||+++https://t.co/Bd2gYPPTKP
+++||+++@thelindsayellis That being said, if your defense of your use is, Ehh, I'm doing your marketing for you, that's not going to get you very far. Yeah, fair use is vague, but it's not anything goes.
+++||+++@angrymice It’s really not vague
+++||+++@thelindsayellis The thing about fair use and video games is that it can be argued watching people play video games is automatically transformative enough from the experience of PLAYING the game that no company should reasonably be able to get on your case for it.
+++||+++@persona_fied Yeah, that’s the thing, you really could argue either way. And unless it gets a verdict in a federal court, we aren’t going to get an answer on that. But I don’t ever think we will, because no game company is that suicidal lol
+++||+++@thelindsayellis I guess people are aguing the self-sabotaging logic of that route.
copyright law is so dumb it's not even worth arguing, should be redone from scratch.
+++||+++@deABREU https://t.co/k8TS48eE6r
+++||+++@thelindsayellis It may be an unpopular opinion, but I have the impression that a broad licensing tool for a reasonable fee might be something YT might get on board. Like "pay 50 bucks for this whole range of possible content and I guarantee you won't be pestered"
+++||+++@masterkawas As others have pointed out, problem with that is rights holders can restrict your portrayal of the media to positive only, or impose other restrictions. It could never apply to me
+++||+++@thelindsayellis And about "that guy", I think some of that feeling about fair use comes from an attitude of "well, we're just imitating what MST3K did" but, like, MST3K had to license those movies, that's why getting a complete set release is so tricky
+++||+++@VoidofIntention Yeah exactly and I imagine that’s part of where that guy’s confusion lay, but he could’ve like, I don’t know, googled it?
+++||+++@thelindsayellis I always wondered why showing trailer footage in your YouTube video is considered okay. Is that some unwritten agreement with marketing departments?
+++||+++@timur_debbag IT’S FAIR USE

AHHHH
+++||+++@thelindsayellis Can you develop this hot take further? I can’t personally imagine what this argument is without immediately leading to restricting streams in general.
+++||+++@ArthurAugustyn oh, I will, soon
+++||+++tl;dr “I’m using ur your content to promote ur content, why u mad??” is not how fair use works.

lord I have been sitting on that for years
+++||+++No one is listening to the “fair use” portion of my fair use diatribe lol
+++||+++@thelindsayellis It CAN be beneficial though.  Take for example the game Among Us.  Years old game at this point blew up suddenly because of a Twitch stream and now it is the most popular streaming game and has more active players than its ever had.
+++||+++@Musubi_Azeyma how many times do I need to repeat myself - i get that it can be beneficial, but that’s not how fair use works. It’s not an argument for fair use
+++||+++@thelindsayellis I sort of made that argument and I think there is some validity to it. Video games are different than movies or illustrations (or other static forms or art) in that seeing someone play it is completely different than playing it yourself.
+++||+++@Hemicrypta For the 800000th time, there’s an argument to be made, but not for fair use. That’s not how fair use works
+++||+++@thelindsayellis I mean, to be fair, there are games I’ve bought because I watched streamers/Let’s Players play them, so there is a point to be made here. It may not entirely hold up, but there is some there there.
+++||+++@KrustyFrank27 But not a point for fair use. That’s not how fair use works.
+++||+++Now that doesn’t mean I think people SHOULD pay licensing fees as he’s implying, buuuhhhhhttt it would surprise me if that starts coming down the pike. I think they would have already except they did the cost benefit analysis of bad optics and went “nah”
+++||+++tl;dr “I’m using ur your content to promote ur content, why u mad??” is not how fair use works.

lord I have been sitting on that for years
+++||+++The true true is that game streaming is allowed to exist not because it’s fair use (ehhhhhnhhh.... debatable) but because it’s a mutually beneficial symbiosis. Like, he’s not wrong for pointing out there but for the grace of corporate game overlords go streaming.

but wait, we both prefer dogs, which of us is he supposed to pity?? I didn't realize preferring dogs meant i don't support trans kids, learn something every day https://t.co/5oxdWbWLy1
+++||+++the "cat people are the most Virtuous and Good pet owners, for they love cats, the best animal to love. and those who aren't very into cats are frankly, kind of bad people" side of twitter is so funny. like how have i seen a take like this so many times, it's extremely extra imo https://t.co/ljNnGJIj8r
+++||+++@biggestjoel peak twitter. like, yes, I can't control cats therefore I don't own one because I don't want a free range animal that will scratch up my furniture, so that means i do not respect the autonomy of others, ever. lol

+++||+++@thelindsayellis I don't wanna make any guesses but reading this last tweet I immediatelly thought of that idiot who made incoherent 12 hours long video rant in response to someone's negative review of the Joker movie. If it's not him then I'm terrified by the fact there are two people like this
+++||+++@HYeahTeenSupers it wasn't him, although I have definitely gotten an e-mail or two from his "assistant" lol
+++||+++@thelindsayellis Also, still impressed you chose not to throw Doug under the bus in your Fair Use video! https://t.co/3i17lODw3o
+++||+++@JohnDRuddy that would require me to refamiliarize myself with his arguments, and woof
+++||+++@thelindsayellis I have some past content that I'm not super proud of anymore. And I waffle between "oh God just take it down" and "leave it up as a signpost of where you were vs now, and own it".

Do you have any thoughts or advice?
+++||+++@froebull take it down, or add a huge disclaimer in the description. ppl just finding your channel have no way of knowing you've moved on.
+++||+++@thelindsayellis Whatever one thinks of Doug now, his network didn't bleed 99% of it's talent on ungratefulness. He clearly holds some responsibility. Like, I'm impressed he still shows his face in public after that happened.
+++||+++@uneek35 oh he has no shame he does not care. I honestly envy him that; i'd love to see the pie chart of my life with the slice of how much time I wasted or hesitated bc some form of shame was holding me back
+++||+++Meanwhile, rising life expectancy of well-off Americans, and the push to choose younger and younger justices to hold onto power, means that these three justices could easily be making decisions for this country for the next 40 years.
+++||+++@hankgreen remembering people telling leftists who didn't like hillary to think of SCOTUS and begging to think strategically in 2016,  only to see SCOTUS roundly ignored by people who think structural power begins and ends with the presidency and trying not to get a n g e r y
+++||+++@thelindsayellis i still that get from people from time to time. the only blessing is that i was so low-profile during that time that most of my current audience doesn't know me from then.
+++||+++@renegadecut BUT I DO

AHAHAHA
+++||+++@thelindsayellis A dude rips off Roger Ebert, Daffy Duck &amp; a broken microphone and you owe him? Bless.

+++||+++Duder in my @'s giving me shit for being "above it all" re: the toxic form of Internet humor/criticism in the early 2010's, when I was IN FACT a part of building it, and like, I know that? I'm not proud of it. I had a hand in the foundation of the SinemaCins landscape of today
+++||+++It was around 2011 that I started to really realize what a toxic form of criticism we were helping to build when I realized how bad my review of Dune was. Like, I still don't like Dune, but my approach to it was just so smug and lazy. Genuinely my nadir, and I've had a few. https://t.co/gZtv5KT5u2

+++||+++Why are these all exactly how the character in the profile pic would insult me on twitter https://t.co/h2cmsUNHO8
+++||+++@JennyENicholson brb writing a YA dystopia where Casuals are the oppressed underclass and True Gamers are the elite aristocracy keeping them down. It's a love story between the classes, only instead of overthrowing the system the newbs get pwned

+++||+++@biggestjoel finally, an issue that effects me
+++||+++I never get this guy's tweets on the first read even though I know the shtick... something about this platform just discourages actually reading it https://t.co/vV18Yu9rFG
+++||+++@ShadowTodd there's a reason i never retweet them, despite the fact that they are the best art on twitter dot com
+++||+++anyway, obviously not a big deal, but I'm not looking forward to it and since it'll probably end up being pretty toothless since most geopolitics will be off limits and I don't think the comedy has aged well. but maybe they'll surprise me and have a fresh approach who knows
+++||+++But let me just put it this way -- I think there's a reason the Animaniacs clips that have endured are the songs and clever plays on words, but not the skits themselves. Hopefully they'll play to that strength.

Pinky and the Brain was never funny tho *SMOKE BOMB*
+++||+++@thelindsayellis Huh; I've only watched an episode or two, but I don't necessarily see anything wrong about a show about a bunch of kids smarter than the adults. Seems a bit like pandering to a child audience, but not, like harmful. You may have been focusing on the unhappiness bit though.
+++||+++@ChanceDPhillips I didn't say it was harmful, I just don't think it has aged well and I don't think an audience in 2020 will find that type of humor funny
+++||+++This is also part of what differentiates Animaniacs from Looney tunes and was very emblematic of kids' humor in the 90's - it's less "defending yourself against a bully" so much as "owning someone else who thinks they're so smart."

+++||+++@thelindsayellis I always felt very bad for Michael Angelo in the episode where they screw up the Sistine Chapel. I think he breaks down in tears a few times :(
+++||+++@TamashiiHiroka literally the one I was thinking about lol

LEAVE HIM ALONE HE JUST TRYNA PAINT
+++||+++@thelindsayellis I wouldn't share these worries if I wasn't also sure of how toothless the show will likely be. If they chose the right targets, the kind of comedy you're describing could be fun and even enriching. But so many corporate/political titans will be off limits.
+++||+++@WookieeOTY oh yeah, like... what are they going to do, pull one over on trump, an actual fascist? is putin gonna get a wedgie?
